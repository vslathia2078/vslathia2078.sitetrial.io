As one taster from our test kitchen, Liz Mervosh put it, "It's more than a copycat. It's better; more fish, more cheese, more sauce. The contrast between the crispy breaded fish and the steamed bun is A+. Skip McDonald's and make your sandwich."

A thick, fish filet is fried (and according to our test kitchen, gets even crispier than the McDonald's version) and then stacked on a steamed bun with that signature tartar sauce. Here's how to make it.  </p>
